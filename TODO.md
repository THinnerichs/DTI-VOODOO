## TODO

5.1. Run best model from 2.1. on that very data
6. Run inductive model graph


7. Literature search!! 


1.1. Find DTI paper which uses drughub
1.5. Build DTIs according to DTI paper 

Also write down failed approach?

3. Build MolPred over that split
4. Build network with semsim as well

Build follwing networks
1. Drug split
2. drughub data test
2.1. Drugs and 
2.2. Proteins with downsampling!
3. molecular features instead of DDIs
4.  

Options:
- Molecular feature vs DDI vs DDI + semsim
- ResNet vs Stacked
- GCN vs GAT vs SAGE
- Protein vs drug split

- results on Drughub
  - proteins
  - drugs

Draw images for Networks
- PPI & DDI & Side effects data
- Molecular predictor
- Graph networks
- Images for splits
