## TODO

2. Build overall model with updated node features for PPI graph 
2.1. input fold mechanism for data -> molecular predictor
2.2. Build fold mechanism for run
3. Run overall model with updated node features for PPI graph 
4. Get data as said from Robert
5. Run updated model on data
5.1. Run best model from 2.1. on that very data
6. Run inductive model graph


7. Literature search!! 


1.1. Find DTI paper which uses drughub
1.5. Build DTIs according to DTI paper 

Also write down failed approach?


1. Get semsim data from Ashraf
2. Adjust network accordingly
3. Build MolPred over that split
4. Build network with semsim as well
