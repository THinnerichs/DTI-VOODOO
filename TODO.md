## TODO

1.1. Find DTI paper which uses drughub
1.5. Build DTIs according to DTI paper 

Also write down failed approach?

Options:
- Molecular feature vs DDI vs DDI + semsim vs. All together
- ResNet vs Stacked
- GCN vs GAT vs SAGE vs others
- Protein vs drug split

- molecular drug representation:
  - SMILES transformer?
  - proper GCN over molecular structure? (What node features? See other papers for that)
  - take model from them and enhance it with PPI graph?
- Model for drug ? For each protein?


Draw images for Networks
- PPI & DDI & Side effects data
- Molecular predictor
- Graph networks
- Images for splits

Robert talk:
  - search bioinformatics for drug repuposing
  - 10 years ago side effect similarity paper in Science  (0.7 AUC)
  - locality in PPI network coincides with phenotypes
    - See paper in Skype

  - function phenotypes
  1.
