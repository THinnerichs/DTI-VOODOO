## Questions:

- which institution for me?
- Approach vs. methods?
- 5000 words is maximum, mandatory or guide?
- What parts can be extended?
- include statement that top-down approaches do not work well for small differences in molecular structure? How to prove? 
- include images/figures for what? 
  - Models
  - Splits?
  - PPI-DDI-SideEffect-DTI network?
- build model for each drug to actually find regions? -> Pattern vs region hypothesis


## Issues
- bibliography style was given like this, but does not look like standard Bioinformatics paper
-
