    abstract = "{Drug–protein interactions (DPIs) underlie the desired therapeutic actions and the adverse side effects of a significant majority of drugs. Computational prediction of DPIs facilitates research in drug discovery, characterization and repurposing. Similarity-based methods that do not require knowledge of protein structures are particularly suitable for druggable genome-wide predictions of DPIs. We review 35 high-impact similarity-based predictors that were published in the past decade. We group them based on three types of similarities and their combinations that they use. We discuss and compare key aspects of these methods including source databases, internal databases and their predictive models. Using our novel benchmark database, we perform comparative empirical analysis of predictive performance of seven types of representative predictors that utilize each type of similarity individually and all possible combinations of similarities. We assess predictive quality at the database-wide DPI level and we are the first to also include evaluation over individual drugs. Our comprehensive analysis shows that predictors that use more similarity types outperform methods that employ fewer similarities, and that the model combining all three types of similarities secures area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.93. We offer a comprehensive analysis of sensitivity of predictive performance to intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics of the considered predictors. We find that predictive performance is sensitive to low levels of similarities between sequences of the drug targets and several extrinsic properties of the input drug structures, drug profiles and drug targets. The benchmark database and a webserver for the seven predictors are freely available at http://biomine.cs.vcu.edu/servers/CONNECTOR/.}",

    abstract = "{In bioinformatics, machine learning-based methods that predict the compound–protein interactions (CPIs) play an important role in the virtual screening for drug discovery. Recently, end-to-end representation learning for discrete symbolic data (e.g. words in natural language processing) using deep neural networks has demonstrated excellent performance on various difficult problems. For the CPI problem, data are provided as discrete symbolic data, i.e. compounds are represented as graphs where the vertices are atoms, the edges are chemical bonds, and proteins are sequences in which the characters are amino acids. In this study, we investigate the use of end-to-end representation learning for compounds and proteins, integrate the representations, and develop a new CPI prediction approach by combining a graph neural network (GNN) for compounds and a convolutional neural network (CNN) for proteins.Our experiments using three CPI datasets demonstrated that the proposed end-to-end approach achieves competitive or higher performance as compared to various existing CPI prediction methods. In addition, the proposed approach significantly outperformed existing methods on an unbalanced dataset. This suggests that data-driven representations of compounds and proteins obtained by end-to-end GNNs and CNNs are more robust than traditional chemical and biological features obtained from databases. Although analyzing deep learning models is difficult due to their black-box nature, we address this issue using a neural attention mechanism, which allows us to consider which subsequences in a protein are more important for a drug compound when predicting its interaction. The neural attention mechanism also provides effective visualization, which makes it easier to analyze a model even when modeling is performed using real-valued representations instead of discrete features.https://github.com/masashitsubakiSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",
