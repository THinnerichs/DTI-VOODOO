    abstract = "{Drug–protein interactions (DPIs) underlie the desired therapeutic actions and the adverse side effects of a significant majority of drugs. Computational prediction of DPIs facilitates research in drug discovery, characterization and repurposing. Similarity-based methods that do not require knowledge of protein structures are particularly suitable for druggable genome-wide predictions of DPIs. We review 35 high-impact similarity-based predictors that were published in the past decade. We group them based on three types of similarities and their combinations that they use. We discuss and compare key aspects of these methods including source databases, internal databases and their predictive models. Using our novel benchmark database, we perform comparative empirical analysis of predictive performance of seven types of representative predictors that utilize each type of similarity individually and all possible combinations of similarities. We assess predictive quality at the database-wide DPI level and we are the first to also include evaluation over individual drugs. Our comprehensive analysis shows that predictors that use more similarity types outperform methods that employ fewer similarities, and that the model combining all three types of similarities secures area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.93. We offer a comprehensive analysis of sensitivity of predictive performance to intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics of the considered predictors. We find that predictive performance is sensitive to low levels of similarities between sequences of the drug targets and several extrinsic properties of the input drug structures, drug profiles and drug targets. The benchmark database and a webserver for the seven predictors are freely available at http://biomine.cs.vcu.edu/servers/CONNECTOR/.}",

abstract = {In this work, we are interested in generalizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) from low-dimensional regular grids, where image, video and speech are represented, to high-dimensional irregular domains, such as social networks, brain connectomes or words' embedding, represented by graphs. We present a formulation of CNNs in the context of spectral graph theory, which provides the necessary mathematical background and efficient numerical schemes to design fast localized convolutional filters on graphs. Importantly, the proposed technique offers the same linear computational complexity and constant learning complexity as classical CNNs, while being universal to any graph structure. Experiments on MNIST and 20NEWS demonstrate the ability of this novel deep learning system to learn local, stationary, and compositional features on graphs.},

    abstract = "{The development of new drugs is costly, time consuming, and often accompanied with safety issues. Drug repurposing can avoid the expensive and lengthy process of drug development by finding new uses for already approved drugs. In order to repurpose drugs effectively, it is useful to know which proteins are targeted by which drugs. Computational models that estimate the interaction strength of new drug–target pairs have the potential to expedite drug repurposing. Several models have been proposed for this task. However, these models represent the drugs as strings, which is not a natural way to represent molecules. We propose a new model called GraphDTA that represents drugs as graphs and uses graph neural networks to predict drug–target affinity. We show that graph neural networks not only predict drug–target affinity better than non-deep learning models, but also outperform competing deep learning methods. Our results confirm that deep learning models are appropriate for drug–target binding affinity prediction, and that representing drugs as graphs can lead to further improvements.The proposed models are implemented in Python. Related data, pre-trained models, and source code are publicly available at https://github.com/thinng/GraphDTA.

    abstract = "{In bioinformatics, machine learning-based methods that predict the compound–protein interactions (CPIs) play an important role in the virtual screening for drug discovery. Recently, end-to-end representation learning for discrete symbolic data (e.g. words in natural language processing) using deep neural networks has demonstrated excellent performance on various difficult problems. For the CPI problem, data are provided as discrete symbolic data, i.e. compounds are represented as graphs where the vertices are atoms, the edges are chemical bonds, and proteins are sequences in which the characters are amino acids. In this study, we investigate the use of end-to-end representation learning for compounds and proteins, integrate the representations, and develop a new CPI prediction approach by combining a graph neural network (GNN) for compounds and a convolutional neural network (CNN) for proteins.Our experiments using three CPI datasets demonstrated that the proposed end-to-end approach achieves competitive or higher performance as compared to various existing CPI prediction methods. In addition, the proposed approach significantly outperformed existing methods on an unbalanced dataset. This suggests that data-driven representations of compounds and proteins obtained by end-to-end GNNs and CNNs are more robust than traditional chemical and biological features obtained from databases. Although analyzing deep learning models is difficult due to their black-box nature, we address this issue using a neural attention mechanism, which allows us to consider which subsequences in a protein are more important for a drug compound when predicting its interaction. The neural attention mechanism also provides effective visualization, which makes it easier to analyze a model even when modeling is performed using real-valued representations instead of discrete features.https://github.com/masashitsubakiSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

    abstract = "{Protein function prediction is one of the major tasks of bioinformatics that can help in wide range of biological problems such as understanding disease mechanisms or finding drug targets. Many methods are available for predicting protein functions from sequence based features, protein–protein interaction networks, protein structure or literature. However, other than sequence, most of the features are difficult to obtain or not available for many proteins thereby limiting their scope. Furthermore, the performance of sequence-based function prediction methods is often lower than methods that incorporate multiple features and predicting protein functions may require a lot of time.We developed a novel method for predicting protein functions from sequence alone which combines deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model with sequence similarity based predictions. Our CNN model scans the sequence for motifs which are predictive for protein functions and combines this with functions of similar proteins (if available). We evaluate the performance of DeepGOPlus using the CAFA3 evaluation measures and achieve an Fmax of 0.390, 0.557 and 0.614 for BPO, MFO and CCO evaluations, respectively. These results would have made DeepGOPlus one of the three best predictors in CCO and the second best performing method in the BPO and MFO evaluations. We also compare DeepGOPlus with state-of-the-art methods such as DeepText2GO and GOLabeler on another dataset. DeepGOPlus can annotate around 40 protein sequences per second on common hardware, thereby making fast and accurate function predictions available for a wide range of proteins.http://deepgoplus.bio2vec.net/.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",
