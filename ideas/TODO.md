## TODO

- Put more comments to code
- Test FAMSA
- Run Alignment on min_score 700 to avoid that many 0 target drugs
- execute hmm_pipeline on MSA results


- calculate side effect similarity matrix (See jupyter notebook)
- finally gather MedDRA data

- get similarity matrix from bipartite graph only (Kovacs?)
- Extract MedDRA data from UMLS data
- is MedDRAFre graph okay? check!
- How to stitch together MedDRA and SIDER graph in networkx (-> visit Maxat)

- how to compare alignments (use blastp for e values)
- how to map e values from [0,inf) with 0 as hit and inf as no hit to [0,1] where 0 no hit and 1 is hit
- how to compare both similarity measures? (-> Maxat)
