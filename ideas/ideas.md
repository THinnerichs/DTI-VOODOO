## TODO

- Have a look at STITCH DB
- for each drug get targets across all organisms
- perform multi sequence alignment (Biopython?)
- use result for query against same database
	- if many results:
		- use position weight matrix for encoding of targets
	- few results:
		- good precision

## Other ideas

- Calculate similarity between drugs and metabolites...
	... over structural similarity
	... over alignment of e.g. SMILES

## On performance of alignments
