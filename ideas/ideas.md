## Important

- Extend VPN access (only valid until 30.12.19)
- Visit ithelpdesk on Sunday for VPN credentials

For Sumyyah: (-> Put it on IBEX)
- STITCH database in RDF
- SIDER as RDF 
- MedDRA? as RDF 

## TODO

- actually do some literature search!!!

- Put more comments to code

- how to map e values from [0,inf) with 0 as hit and inf as no hit to [0,1] where 0 no hit and 1 is hit

- get phenotypes for drugs
  - download OMIM -> get mapping
  - Human phenotype ontology

---------------------------------------------------
- read Roberts Hypothesis testing paper for title and outline

- are there papers on DTI using PPIs?

- test unsupervised node embedding learning
- Get other method to run on my dataset (literature!!)
  - HAve to get SMILES and stuff too -> meh
  - How can this be made proof? Model is tweaked on this dataset while foreign methods are not

- read PREDICT paper
- maybe try other stellargraph embeddings as well :)))
- run link prediction over whole graph

- run unsupervised methods now as more RAM is available

----------------------------------------------------

- run graphsage as link predictor
- extract predictions from search results

- Read paper how convolution over node features is done
  - Otherwise use same structure but with different node labels?

- update targets based on new alignments
  - update after new hmm\_search went trough :)


----------------------------------------------------
Talk with Robert on 03.12.:
- Test Graphsage
- Get Phenotypes from OMIM
- Hypothesis is about



## Ideas for presentation

- include numbers of interactions
  - histograms?
- Other approaches lack ability to generalize -> guilt by association

- histogram over scores of STRING and STITCH
- show image of network for STRING and STITCH
- Meaning of score 
- Functions to slides B)


## Other ideas

- Calculate similarity between drugs and metabolites...
	... over structural similarity
	... over alignment of e.g. SMILES

- get DD similarity trough ATC code/hierarchy?

## On performance of alignments

## Questions



- What is the actual hypothesis? 
- What could be some meat to add here?
## Databases

- CTD
