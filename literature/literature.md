- Reviewing papers on drug-protein-interactions
- Models using more similarities tend to perform better
- Models using ensemble techniques need more time in exchange for better performance
- Models using only Protein similarities perform really bad (See figure 4)


## Some quotes:

  >  DrugBank's list of drug targets is 3–4 times larger than these. The primary reasons are: (i) DrugBank has a much larger collection of small molecule drugs (approximately two times larger than any other resource), (ii) DrugBank includes biotech drugs and nutraceuticals (which average 5–10 unique target proteins per drug), (iii) most other drug target lists only include a single ‘primary’ target rather than all targets that have been found to have physiological or pharmaceutical effects, (iv) DrugBank fully accounts for the fact that many drug targets are protein complexes composed of multiple subunits or combinations of subunits and (v) DrugBank annotators identify molecules as drug targets if they play a critical role in the transport, delivery or activation of the drug.
