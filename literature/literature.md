### [Review and comparative assessment of similarity-based methods for prediction of drugâ€“protein interactions in the druggable human proteome](https://academic.oup.com/bib/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bib/bby069/5066711?searchresult=1)
- Reviewing papers on drug-protein-interactions
- Models using more similarities tend to perform better
- Models using ensemble techniques need more time in exchange for better performance
- Models using only Protein similarities perform really bad (See figure 4)
