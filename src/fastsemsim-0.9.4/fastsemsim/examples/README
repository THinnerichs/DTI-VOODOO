Test folder

This folder contains scripts for testing whether fastSemSim works correctly.
Run them from within this folder, otherwise they'll complain about missing data.

If fastSemSim library has not been installed, the local path to the library might have to  be added to PYTHONPATH using the export command.
Example: if fastSemSim has been downloaded in a folder with path 'path-to-x', then you should use
	
	export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:'path-to-x'

before executing any fastSemSim test. Under Windows, set the python library path variable from Control Panel.
Please note that you still need to install the Python packages required by fastSemSim (e.g. pandas).

Instead, if you installed fastSemSim correctly, you should be able to run any test script without setting any additional environment variable.
