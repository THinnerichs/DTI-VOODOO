Thanks for downloading FastSemSim.

fatSemSim has been tested on Python >= 2.5
Staring from version 0.9, fastsemsim requires the numpy and pandas packages.

To install, simply run from the command prompt:

    python setup.py install

You might need to run the command in privileged mode (e.g. using sudo):

	sudo python setup.py install


Note for Linux and OS X users: in some systems the Python interpreter has to be invoked using the command 'python2' instead of 'python'. You might need to modify the fastsemsim.sh script accordingly.

For more detailed instructions, see the documentation available online.
